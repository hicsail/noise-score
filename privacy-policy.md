# Privacy Policy - NoiseScore #
This Privacy Policy explains information gathering and use practices for the NoiseScore application (the “App”).  The App is controlled by Trustees of Boston University (the “University”) and administered and managed by the Community Noise Lab, a research lab at the Boston University School of Public Health (the “Lab”).  The App is a free smartphone application designed to gather both objective and subjective information about community noise levels. This community engagement research tool allows you to provide measurable and spatial input about your experience with noise. Researchers will analyze information gathered from users of NoiseScore to conduct research, including research on the impact of noise pollution on health and well-being. 


When you download and use the app, you will be asked to read our terms and conditions and agree with them. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not access or use the App. 


It is your decision whether to participate in this study and you may choose to stop using the App at any time. The Lab is conducting this research to gather a deeper understanding about your thoughts, feelings, and behaviors about the sounds you encounter in your everyday life. When you first create an account, you will answer a short survey so that we can learn a little more about who you are and your general attitudes about community noise and sound issues.  With this App, you will be able to create a noise event. With each noise event you create, you will measure its sound level (in decibels), map your location, record the noise sources (barking dog, siren, aircraft, etc.) and answer a series of questions designed to gather your opinions on how this noise event made you feel. Once you submit your noise event, your responses will be added to our live heat map. The data provided by you and other research participants ("participants") will be collected and used for research purposes. Upon completion of a NoiseScore noise event, you will be able to view an aggregation of ALL participant responses via the App heat map. You will also be able to review your historical records. 


This Privacy Policy does not apply to any third party applications or software that integrates with the App, or any other third party products, services or businesses.
## Information Collection & Use ##
### Information you provide ###
The University does not collect personally identifiable information about you when you download the App unless you voluntarily provide that information.
1.	User Background


The App obtains information you provide when you download the App and respond to the survey to create an account. The survey will ask you to create a username and will request your email address, city and state of residence, zip code, preferred pronoun, birth year, and ethnicity.  The survey will also ask a series of questions regarding your sensitivity to noise; the noise levels in your home, community, and work; and your general state of health (‘very poor’ to ‘excellent’). In addition, the University may request personally identifiable information from you if, for example, you ask a question or request to be contacted. 

2.	Decibel Measurements


The App includes a feature that you may use to measure decibel levels around you. The App stores the decibel measurements, when and where they were taken, your comments on the noise sources, and your reflections on how the sounds made you feel.

## Information Gathered Automatically ## 
When you use the App, the University may collect and store digital information sent by your mobile device, including IP addresses (i.e., the internet address of your computer or device), geolocation, the device operating system, unique device identifiers, and other digital property, such as cookies, installation events, app crashes, pages visited, length of visit, and browser types  The University does not link IP addresses or cookies to any personally identifiable information.

## Information Security ## 
The University has implemented reasonable physical, technical and administrative procedures to safeguard and secure information it collects online against unauthorized disclosure, loss, or misuse, in accordance with the Data Protection Standards Policy.  Under that Policy, the University has classified data according to its sensitivity, and set requirements for protection accordingly.
The University cannot provide an absolute guarantee as to the security of any information transmitted through its website or digital properties.   

## Information Sharing ##
The University will share de-identified, aggregate data collected via the App in the NoiseScore map accessible in the App. The map shows decibel measurements, locations, dates, times, and noise sources.  The map does not show user names or personally identifiable information. 
Researchers will share data where we have removed anything that we think would show your identity. There still may be a small chance that someone could figure out that the information is about you. Such sharing includes:


*	Publishing results in a medical book or journal.
*	Adding results to a Federal government database.
*	Using research data in future studies, done by us or by other scientists.


Like most smartphone applications, the App uses third-party entities, such as hosting companies or technology platforms, to facilitate the App.  These third-party entities track Internet services and record the data in log files. The log files include information such as Internet Protocol addresses, the date and time that users accessed web pages or other Internet services, installation events, app crashes, browser types, and cookies. These third parties will provide protection at least as strong as the protections described in this Privacy Policy.  


Otherwise, the University will share information about you with third-parties only to the extent necessary to deliver the App’s services (i.e. with third party hosting companies or technology companies subject to confidentiality obligations or in circumstances where the University reasonably believes that doing so is necessary or appropriate to: satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process or governmental request; investigate compliance with or enforce University policies; detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues; or protect the rights, property or safety of the University, its faculty, staff, and students or others.  The information referred to in this section may include personally identifiable information.  

## Third Party Websites ##
The App may link to websites that are not controlled by the University (“Third Party Sites”).  The University is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of Third Party Sites.  

## Children’s Privacy ##
The App is not intended for use by persons under 18 years old; if you are under 18 years of age, you should not use the App. From time to time, the University may review accounts and delete records of persons under 18 years old. 

##Changes to this Privacy Policy##
The University may modify this Privacy Policy from time to time.  Changes will be effective on the date posted.

## Data Retention/Deletion Policies ##
Information collected through the App will be kept after the end of the research study conducted by the Lab.


Subject to exemptions provided by law, you may have the right to request access to information that the App has collected about you, as well as to seek to update, delete or correct this information. You may be able to do this within the App, but if you cannot, you may contact <edw@bu.edu> for assistance. We may not be able to delete information about you that has been de-identified and aggregated. 

## Questions ##
Questions about this Privacy Policy should be directed to <edw@bu.edu>. The investigator or a member of the research team will try to answer questions you may have about the research being conducted. If you have questions or concerns, or need to report an injury suffered while participating in this research, contact Erica Walker at 617-358-2439 or <edw@bu.edu>. You may also contact the Boston Medical Center and Boston University Medical Campus IRB at 617-358-5372 or email <medirb@bu.edu>. The IRB is a group that helps monitor research. You should call or email the IRB if you want to find out about your rights as a research subject. You should also call or email if you want to talk to someone who is not part of the study about your questions, concerns, or problems.
